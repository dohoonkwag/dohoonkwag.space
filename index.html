    <p>I'm a second year student at Rice University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
    <p>This website is my way of documenting my growth throughout my career. My hope is that, over time, this becomes a place where someone looking for guidance can find real experiences, advice, and answers from someone who's been through a lot of the same things. This website is also a personal project of mineâ€”I'm doing this for myself, too. I learn best when I teach, so this is my attempt to solidify what I learn by teaching it to a small corner on the internet.</p>
