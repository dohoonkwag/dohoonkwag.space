    <h1 class="hi">Hi, I'm Dohoon!</h1>
    <p>I'm a second year student at Rice University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
    <p>This website is my way of documenting my growth throughout my career. My hope is that one day, someone seeking guidance can find real experiences, advice, and answers here from someone who's been through it. I'm also doing this for myself. I learn best when I teach, so this is my attempt to solidify what I learn by teaching it to a small corner on the internet.</p>
